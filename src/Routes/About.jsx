     I fell in love with hairdressing at a young age, I think because my father was a barber when I was growing up.
     I used to love to sit in his barber shop and watch how he did different styles and cuts, while there was a long queue out his door.
     My favourite part about hairdressing must be the different styles you can do and how you can transform someoneâ€™s look with a quick cut.
     Please feel free to give me a call for a quick consultation.
